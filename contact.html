        <p class="content"> Machine Learning (ML) is concerned about developing systems that improve their performance with experience. In the last decade progress in AI can easily be attributed to the advances in ML. ML is so popular that it has become synonymous with AI. The researchers are now focusing on scaling the state-of-the-art ML algorithms to large datasets. For more information on ML read this introductory blog.</p>
        <p class="content"> Technically speaking, Robotics is a separate branch of its own but it do has some overlap with AI. AI has made robot navigation in dynamic environment possible. How do you make sure that a self driving car goes from point A to point B without harming itself and anyone else in the least time? Advances in DL, RL probably have answers to such questions in Robotics. For more information on robotics read this blog on AI powered Robotics and watch these demonstration videos: 1, 2, 3. </p>
