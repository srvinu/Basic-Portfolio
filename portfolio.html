        <p class="content"> The Human-Computer Interaction Group studies interaction in future computing environments including the office, home, mobile and medical. Emphasis on context-aware systems, perceptual interfaces (like computer vision and speech), visualization and learning technologies. The BID lab is a 4000-sq ft lab designed to foster collaboration, and houses about 25 students from CS, ME, BioE and Art practice. The Tele-immersive lab has about 10 students and postdocs from EECS, Humanities and Dance department and has extensive collaboration with faculty from University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.</p>
        <p class="content"> Technically speaking, Robotics is a separate branch of its own but it do has some overlap with AI. AI has made robot navigation in dynamic environment possible. How do you make sure that a self driving car goes from point A to point B without harming itself and anyone else in the least time? Advances in DL, RL probably have answers to such questions in Robotics. For more information on robotics read this blog on AI powered Robotics and watch these demonstration videos: 1, 2, 3. </p>
